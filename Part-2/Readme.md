## RNNs and LSTMs
- [A blog post on RNNs and LSTMs](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah
  - This is the shortest and most accessible read.
- [Deep Learning Book chapter on RNNs](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html)
  - This will be a very technical read and is recommended for students very comfortable with advanced mathematical notation and scientific papers.
- [Lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX5V1WpxxkY) Andrej Karpathy
  - This is a fairly long lecture (around an hour) but covers the content quite well as always with Karpathy.
