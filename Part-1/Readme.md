## Books to Read
- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew Trask
  - This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.
- [Neural Networks And Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen
  - This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with
- [The Deep Learning Textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
  - This online book has lot of material and is the most rigorous of the three books suggested.

## Intro to Neural Networks

- [CS224d: TensorFlow Tutorial](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/lectures/CS224d-Lecture7.pdf)

## Backpropagation
- [Yes, you should understand backprop](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b#.vt3ax2kg9) from Andrej Karpathy
